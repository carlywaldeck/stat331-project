## Introduction

**Research Question**

Over the course of this project, our groups hopes to answer the following question:

*Is there an association between gross domestic product per capita and food consumption?*

**Background**

We hypothesize that there will be a positive linear relationship with GDP and calories. Foremost, there is a positive linear association with GDP per capita and quality of life. Using this knowledge, that as GDP per capita increases, food abundance would increase, causing the number of calories consumed to also increase. Also, using GDP per capita as a measure of income, as income rises, one is able to afford more. Under the assumption of monotonicity, more is better, and the income effect, one would believe that an increase in overall income would allow people to buy more food (more is better) and have to work less (more time to leisure--eat) (Sands 2024). Furthermore, poorer nations, nations with less GDP per capita [suffer more from malnutrition](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/nutrition/overview).

**Summary of Data**

Our team will explore two datasets in our analysis: Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and food supply.

GDP per capita provides a measure of a country's total economic output, divided by the nation's population. The variable is adjusted for inflation by fixing prices to 2017 dollars, and measured in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) dollars. PPP dollars offer a virtual currency used to facilitate international economic comparisons. The [dataset](https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd001/) contains observations for 195 countries, providing estimates spanning from 1800 to 2100. The dataset from 1820 to 1990 is from the [Maddison Project Database](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/releases/maddison-project-database-2023) and the data from 1990 to 2022 is from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD). When the World Bank or the Maddison Project did not have data, the data was taken from estimates from the Penn World Table. Then, if data is still needed Gapminder uses previous versions of their own data.

The food supply dataset, sourced from the [United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home), provides insight into a country's food security and nutritional status. The dataset offers annual observations of a country's food supply by measuring kilocalories per person per day. The dataset contains observations for 179 countries, spanning from 1961 to 2018.

## Data Cleaning

                .fns = ~ case_when(str_detect(.x, "k") ~ as.numeric(str_remove(.x, "k")) * 1000, TRUE ~ as.numeric(.x)))) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = !country,
               names_to = "year")

  mutate(across(.cols = !country,
                .fns = ~as.numeric(.x))) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = !country,
               names_to = "year")

         country = as_factor(country))

```

```{r}
# clean data then take mean of data from 2012-2018 so we have one x and one y value for each country

food_summary <- food |>
  select("country", "2012", "2013", "2014", "2015",
         "2016", "2017", "2018") |>
  mutate(avg_food = rowMeans(across(`2012`:`2018`), na.rm = TRUE))|> 
  drop_na() |>
  select(country, avg_food)

gdp_summary <- gdp |>
  select(country, `2012`, `2013`, `2014`, `2015`, `2016`, `2017`, `2018`) |>
  mutate(across(`2012`:`2018`, ~ {
    ifelse(str_detect(.x, "k$"),
           as.numeric(str_remove(.x, "k")) * 1000,
           as.numeric(.x)
    )
  })) |>
  mutate(average_gdp = rowMeans(across(`2012`:`2018`), na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  select(country, average_gdp)

food_gdp <- left_join(food_summary, gdp_summary, by = "country")
```

**Data Cleaning Process**

The data on food consumption contains 32 fewer countries than the data on GDP per capita, and the nutrition data has 2 countries not present in the GDP data. Thus, when combining the data sets, we did not include those countries. Additionally, the data on GDP per capita spans from 1800 to 2100 and has data in "k" units representing thousands. So, we converted all "k" units into 1000s. However, the data on food consumption spans from 1961 to 2018. So, to make sure the years for the data consistent, we only data from GDP per capita from 1961 to 2018. Finally, there are several observations that did not have data on the kilocalories consumed. So, we cleaned our data to only include the years where there was data.

*Data Cleaning Potential Impact*

The majority of countries included in the GDP data but not the nutrition data are very small in population and/or remote. Omitted countries include Andorra (population 80,856), Bermuda (population 64,698), and Seychelles (population 119,773). There are two countries present in the nutrition data, but not the GDP data: USSR and Yugoslavia. These countries no longer exist. To observe trends over time, it will only be important to include countries with long-term trends.

Since we did not include every country in the GDP per capita data, our analysis may be limited. Furthermore, we only include years for which we had data from both the GDP per capita and food consumption data set.

## Modeling the Relationship between GDP per Capita and Food Consumption in Kilocalories

```{r}
# clean data then take mean of data from 2012-2018 so we have one x and one y value for each country

food_summary <- food |>
  select("country", "2012", "2013", "2014", "2015",
         "2016", "2017", "2018") |>
  mutate(avg_food = rowMeans(across(`2012`:`2018`), na.rm = TRUE))|> 
  drop_na() |>
  select(country, avg_food)

gdp_summary <- gdp |>
  select(country, `2012`, `2013`, `2014`, `2015`, `2016`, `2017`, `2018`) |>
  mutate(across(`2012`:`2018`, ~ {
    ifelse(str_detect(.x, "k$"),
           as.numeric(str_remove(.x, "k")) * 1000,
           as.numeric(.x)
    )
  })) |>
  mutate(average_gdp = rowMeans(across(`2012`:`2018`), na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  select(country, average_gdp)

food_gdp <- left_join(food_summary, gdp_summary, by = "country")
```

```{r}
# Joining datasets to include one obs. per country/year combination

gdp_longer <- gdp |>
  mutate(across(.cols = !country,
                .fns = ~ case_when(str_detect(.x, "k") ~ as.numeric(str_remove(.x, "k")) * 1000, TRUE ~ as.numeric(.x)))) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = !country,
               names_to = "year")

food_supply_longer <- food |>
  mutate(across(.cols = !country,
                .fns = ~as.numeric(.x))) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = !country,
               names_to = "year")

data_joined <- gdp_longer |>
  inner_join(food_supply_longer, # only include matching rows
             join_by(country, year)) |>
  rename(gdp_pcap = "value.x",
         food_supply = "value.y") |>
  drop_na() |>
  mutate(year = as_factor(str_extract(year, pattern = "[:digit:]{1,}")),
         country = as_factor(country))

```

The graph below shows a scatterplot of the average of the log of GDP per Capita (log(GDP per Capita)) and the average of the log Food Consumption (log(Food Consumption))from 2012 to 2018.

```{r}
## scatterplot with line of best fit
ggplot(data = food_gdp, aes(x = log(average_gdp), y = log(avg_food))) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Food Consumption vs Average GDP",
    x = "log(Average GDP)",
    y = "log(Average Food Consumption)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

It can be seen from the scatterplot above that, after applying a logarithmic transformation, there is a moderate, positive, linear relationship between the average log(GDP per Capita) and the average log(Food Consumtpion) for the subsetted data from 2012-2018.

The following animation shows how the relationship between log(Food Consumption) and log(GDP per Capita) has changed over time.

![](animation.gif)

It can be seen that the relationship between log(GDP per Capita) and log(Food Consumption) initially is weak, positive, and linear, but evolves to a stronger, positive, linear relationship over time.

```{r, results='hide'}
## run linear regression
model <- lm(log(avg_food) ~ log(average_gdp), data = food_gdp)
summary(model)
```

In order to better observe and quantify the relationship between food consumption and GDP per capita, a linear regression model was fit. The relationship between the original variables was not linear, so a logarithmic transformation was applied to both.

The following equation represents the fitted regression model, where $\widehat{food_i}$ represents the predicted average food consumption (kcal/person/day) and $GDP_i$ represents average GDP per capita (USD).

$$\log{(\widehat{food}_i)} = 6.895 + 0.1125\log{(GDP_i)}$$

A 10% increase in average GDP per capita is associated with approximately a 1% increase in average food consumption.

The expected natural logarithm of average food consumption is 6.895 when the natural logarithm of average GDP per capita is zero. On a non-logarithmic scale, this corresponds to an expected average food supply of 987.3 kcal/person/day when average GDP per capita is \$1 USD.

## Model Fit

The table shows the model fit for the linear regression model.

```{r}

# find variance
A <- var(log(food_gdp$avg_food), na.rm = TRUE)     
B <- var(fitted(model), na.rm = TRUE)                
resid_var <- var(residuals(model), na.rm = TRUE)      
r_squared <- B / A 

# create table
tibble(
  Metric = c(
    "Variance in response",
    "Variance in fitted values",
    "Variance in residuals",
    "Model R²"
  ),
  Value = c(A, B, resid_var, r_squared)
) |>
  mutate(Value = round(Value, 2)) |>
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Regression Summary Statistics") |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed",
                                      "responsive"), full_width = FALSE,
                position = "left")

```

62% of variability in average food consumption is explained by GDP per capita. Thus, 38% of the variability in average food consumption is not explained by GDP per capita. This suggests that while the model captures some of the relationship, it does not provide a strong fit. Ideally the R\^2 value would be much higher, to indicate a more reliable and predictive model.

## Cross-Validation

To test our regression model, we are using cross validation. Simply put, we are randomly assigning our data into 10 folds, called a 10-fold CV. Then, we use 9 of those folds to train the model. The remaining fold is the test fold, which we see how well our model can predict by retaining its R\^2. This process is repeated 9 additional times, until all 10 folds are each used as a test. The results of the cross-validation (see below) will then be used to determine the predictive ability of our model

```{r}
# Separate into folds
set.seed(123)
k <- 10
n <- nrow(food_gdp)

food_gdp_rand <- food_gdp |> 
  mutate(fold_random = sample(rep_len(1:k, length.out = n),
                              size = n))

# k-fold function
cross <- function(x, food_gdp) {
  fold_dat <- food_gdp |> 
    filter(fold_random == x)
  train_dat <- food_gdp |> 
    filter(fold_random != x)
  
  model <- lm(log(avg_food) ~ log(average_gdp), data = train_dat)
  
  # generate predictions for the held-out fold data
  fold_preds <- predict(model, newdata = fold_dat)
  
  cv_r2 <- var(fold_preds, na.rm = TRUE)/var(log(fold_dat$avg_food), na.rm = TRUE)
  
}


r_sq_k_fold <- map_dbl(.x = 1:k,
                       .f = ~cross(.x, food_gdp_rand))

avg_rsq <- mean(r_sq_k_fold)
```

```{r}
# Plot
as.data.frame(r_sq_k_fold) |>
  arrange(r_sq_k_fold) |> 
  ggplot(aes(y = r_sq_k_fold,
             x = 1:10)
         ) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(r_sq_k_fold)), 
             color = "red") +
  theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank())+
  labs(title = "Cross Validation R²",
       y ="R²", x = "", 
       caption = "The red line is the average R² from the Cross Validation tests.")
```

All the folds have an R\^2 of at least 0.50, which means that at 50% of the variation in a country's food consumption is explained by it's GDP per capita. The variation in R\^2 varies from about 50% to over 90% between folds. The R\^2 from fitting the model on the full dataset was 0.62, and the average R\^2 across folds is 0.642, so it appears the model is neither overfitting or underfitting.

## Conclusion

Based on our regression model, we conclude that there is a positive association between GDP per capita and food consumption in kilocalories. Thus, as GDP per capita increases, food consumption is expected to also increase. Since our model was not over or underfitting, we conclude that around 62% of the variation in food consumption is explained by GDP per capita. Furthermore, for every 10% increase in GDP per capita, food consumption should increase by around 1%. These results back our hypothesis that there will be a positive linear relationship with GDP and calories.
