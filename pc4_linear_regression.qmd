## 2.1 Data Visualization

```{r}
# clean data then take mean of data from 2012-2018 so we have one x and one y value for each country

food_summary <- food |>
  select("country", "2012", "2013", "2014", "2015",
         "2016", "2017", "2018") |>
  mutate(avg_food = rowMeans(across(`2012`:`2018`), na.rm = TRUE))|> 
  drop_na() |>
  select(country, avg_food)

gdp_summary <- gdp |>
  select(country, `2012`, `2013`, `2014`, `2015`, `2016`, `2017`, `2018`) |>
  mutate(across(`2012`:`2018`, ~ {
    ifelse(str_detect(.x, "k$"),
           as.numeric(str_remove(.x, "k")) * 1000,
           as.numeric(.x)
    )
  })) |>
  mutate(average_gdp = rowMeans(across(`2012`:`2018`), na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  select(country, average_gdp)

food_gdp <- left_join(food_summary, gdp_summary, by = "country")
```

We subsetted the data to only include data from 2012 to 2018, the six most recent years. Then, we took the mean of the data to get a single measurement of GPD per capita and food consumed. Thus, we obtained the average GDP per capita and average food consumed (kcal/person/day) for each country.

```{r}
## scatterplot with line of best fit
ggplot(data = food_gdp, aes(x = log(average_gdp), y = log(avg_food))) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Average Food Consumption vs Average GDP",
    x = "log(Average GDP)",
    y = "log(Average Food Consumption)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

It can be seen from the scatterplot above that, after applying a logarithmic transformation, there is a moderate, positive, linear relationship between log(Average GDP per Capita) and log(Average Food Consumption) for the subsetted data from 2012-2018.

```{r}
# Joining datasets to include one obs. per country/year combination

gdp_longer <- gdp |>
  mutate(across(.cols = !country,
                .fns = ~ case_when(str_detect(.x, "k") ~ as.numeric(str_remove(.x, "k")) * 1000, TRUE ~ as.numeric(.x)))) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = !country,
               names_to = "year")

food_supply_longer <- food |>
  mutate(across(.cols = !country,
                .fns = ~as.numeric(.x))) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = !country,
               names_to = "year")

data_joined <- gdp_longer |>
  inner_join(food_supply_longer, # only include matching rows
             join_by(country, year)) |>
  rename(gdp_pcap = "value.x",
         food_supply = "value.y") |>
  drop_na() |>
  mutate(year = as_factor(str_extract(year, pattern = "[:digit:]{1,}")),
         country = as_factor(country))

```

The following animation shows how the relationship between food consumption and GDP per capita has changed over time.

```{r}
#| eval: false

# create animated scatterplot

data_joined_2 <- data_joined |>
  mutate(year = as.numeric(as.character(year)))
animation <- ggplot(data_joined_2, aes(x = log(gdp_pcap), y = log(food_supply), color = country)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Food Consumption vs GDP Over Time",
    subtitle = "Year: {frame_time}",
    x = "log(GDP per Capita (USD))",
    y = "log(Food Consumption (kcal/person/day))"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')

animate(animation, width = 800, height = 600, nframes = 58, fps = 10)
anim_save("animation.gif", animation, width = 800, height = 600, nframes = 58, fps = 10)

```

It can be seen that the relationship between log(GDP per Capita) and log(Food Consumption) initially is weak, positive, and linear, but evolves to a stronger, positive, linear relationship over time.

## 2.2 Linear Regression

```{r, results='hide'}
## run linear regression
model <- lm(log(avg_food) ~ log(average_gdp), data = food_gdp)
summary(model)
```

In order to better observe and quantify the relationship between food consumption and GDP per capita, a linear regression model was fit. The relationship between the original variables was not linear, so a logarithmic transformation was applied to both.

The following equation represents the fitted regression model, where $\widehat{food_i}$ represents the predicted average food consumption (kcal/person/day) and $GDP_i$ represents average GDP per capita (USD).

$$\log{(\widehat{food}_i)} = 6.895 + 0.1125\log{(GDP_i)}$$

A 1% increase in average GDP per capita is associated with approximately a 0.1125% increase in average food consumption.

The expected natural logarithm of average food consumption is 6.895 when the natural logarithm of average GDP per capita is zero. On a non-logarithmic scale, this corresponds to an expected average food supply of 987.3 kcal/person/day when average GDP per capita is \$1 USD.

## 2.3 Model Fit

```{r}

# find variance
A <- var(log(food_gdp$avg_food), na.rm = TRUE)     
B <- var(fitted(model), na.rm = TRUE)                
resid_var <- var(residuals(model), na.rm = TRUE)      
r_squared <- B / A 

# create table
tibble(
  Metric = c(
    "Variance in response",
    "Variance in fitted values",
    "Variance in residuals",
    "Model RÂ²"
  ),
  Value = c(A, B, resid_var, r_squared)
) |>
  mutate(Value = round(Value, 2)) |>
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Regression Summary Statistics") |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "condensed",
                                      "responsive"), full_width = FALSE,
                position = "left")

```

62% of variability in average food consumption is explained by GDP per capita. Thus, 38% of the variability in average food consumption is not explained by GDP per capita. This suggests that while the model captures some of the relationship, it does not provide a strong fit. Ideally the R\^2 value would be much higher, to indicate a more reliable and predictive model.
